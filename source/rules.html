                    The object of Texas Holdem is to make the best 5 card poker hand from the 5 community cards on the table and your own 2 cards that only you can see. The community cards are dealt out during the hand with betting rounds in between so you are betting on the likleyhood of forming a winning hand by the end of the hand when all cards are revealed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A game consists of playing hands of cards and each hand is split into alternating rounds of revealing cards and betting on the results.

                    Your good buddy has lent you $10K to join a high stakes poker game. Whatever profit or loss you make whilst playing in a game will be added or deducted from your total bankroll whenever you leave a table. The total bankroll determines your player ranking.
